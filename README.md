# Safe-Policy
  Safe Policy is a policy-based project featuring a dynamic form journey for calculating policy premiums. The premium is determined based on factors such as annual income, premium paying term, policy term, and payment frequency. Currently, the project includes one productâ€”Life Insurance, but it is designed to support the addition of multiple products in the future.
